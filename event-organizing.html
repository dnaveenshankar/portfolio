        <h1>Event Organizing? Oh, Iâ€™ve Got Stories!</h1>

        <p>
            I never thought Iâ€™d enjoy planning events â€” until I actually did one. Then another. And then five more. Soon, organizing became one of my favorite ways to combine creativity, tech, and community building.
        </p>

        <p>
            As <span class="highlight">Association Chairperson</span> and an <span class="highlight">IIC Student Ambassador</span>, I got the chance to design, host, and coordinate events that connected students, professionals, and ideas. From coding challenges to awareness drives, it was about creating impact â€” and making sure everyone had a good time doing it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hereâ€™s a peek at the kinds of things Iâ€™ve pulled off:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Tech Talks</span> with industry experts (with zero mic issues, promise!)</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Hackathons & Coding Marathons</span> that went from snacks to sunrise</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Project Exhibitions</span> showcasing student innovations</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Cultural Events</span> that blended tradition with tech</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Event organizing taught me more than logistics â€” it sharpened my people skills, time management, and problem-solving instincts. And most importantly, it showed me how much fun collaboration can be.
        </p>

        <p>
            Got an event idea? Or maybe you want tips on setting one up yourself? Hit me up â€” Iâ€™d love to help you build your next big thing.
