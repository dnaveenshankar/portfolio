    <h1>Leading a Team 💼</h1>

    <p>
      Leadership isn’t just about giving directions — it’s about bringing people together, inspiring action, and unlocking potential. Over the years, I’ve been fortunate to lead multiple initiatives, from tech to cultural events, where each challenge taught me something new about teamwork and growth.
