        <h1>Innovative Problem Solving</h1>

        <p>
            You know those moments when everything’s on the line, the clock’s ticking, and everyone’s looking at you
            like
            “What now?” — yeah, that’s where I thrive.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Innovative problem solving isn't just about fixing bugs or coding logic—</span> it's
            about navigating
            real-world chaos with calm. Be it planning an event with last-minute resource changes or adjusting roles on
            the fly when
            a speaker cancels, I’ve learned how to keep the show running without a hitch.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Plan B?</span> Always. <span class="highlight">Plan C?</span> Already in motion.
            <strong>Having fallback strategies is my superpower.</strong>
            I believe every great leader or planner should know how to improvise and innovate, especially under
            pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of the approaches I swear by:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Root Cause Thinking</span> – Fix the source, not just the surface.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Divide & Conquer</span> – Whether it’s a coding bug or crowd issue, break it
                down to solve it smart.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Flexible Planning</span> – Built-in contingency plans that adapt to change on
                the go.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Team Dynamics</span> – Listening, leading, and leaning on the right people at
                the right time.</li>
            <li><strong style="color:#b50909">Backup plans (B, C, even D) are not optional—they're essentials with
                    me.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether it's managing an event glitch, resolving a tech hiccup, or just breaking down a logic puzzle,
            I bring both creativity and calm to the table. If you’re stuck in a challenge or planning something big,
            <a href="contact-me.html" target="_blank">book a session with me</a>—let’s solve it together with style.
